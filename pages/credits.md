<p>William J. Maxwell is a professor of English and African and African American Studies at Washington University in St. Louis, where he teaches modern American and African American literature. Professor Maxwell created the <em>F. B. Eyes Digital Archive</em> as a digital companion to his book. <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10321.html"><em>F.B. Eyes: How J. Edgar Hoover's Ghostreaders Framed African American Literature&nbsp;</em></a>which is published and distributed by Princeton University Press. Professor Maxwell is the author of <em>New Negro, Old Left: African American Writing and Communism between the Wars</em> and the editor of Claude McKay's <em>Complete Poems</em>. He can be reached at <a href="mailto:wmaxwell@wustl.edu">wmaxwell@wustl.edu</a>.</p>

<p>The first version of the F.B. Eyes Digital Archive was built at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) in conjunction with William J. Maxwell's <em>F.B. Eyes</em> book project using Omeka Classic. Jaydee Lee scanned thousands of pages of FBI documents and contributed to the design of the exhibit. Paulo Loonin wrote and developed the Omeka digital archive. Technical and design assistance was provided by Shannon Davis at the WUSTL department of Digital Library Services.  Summer fellowships from the Humanities Digital Workshop of the WUSTL School of Arts &amp; Sciences supported the work of Jaydee and Paulo.</p>

<p>Staff at Washington University Libraries created this second version of the digital archive uses <a href="https://collectionbuilder.github.io/">CollectionBuilder</a>, a static site generator developed at the University of Idaho, using minimal computing principles. Mitch Sumner and Elizabeth Schwartz migrated the FBI files from the Omeka instance to an <a href="https://archive.org/details/FBEyes">Internet Archive collection</a> to ensure longer term access to these files. Elizabeth Schwartz rebuilt the CollectionBuilder-based site.</p>
